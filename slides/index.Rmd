# R <br> language
Any questions?

## R is a language
```{r language, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
url <- "https://source.unsplash.com/ZzWsHbu2y80/256x455"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

## R has values
- 1
- "North Carolina"
- "2020-04-08"

## R has objects
- A name without quotes  
- Assigned using `<-` (looks like an arrow pointing left)  
- Can be a value, object, or function result  

## Try assigning an object 
1. Assign an object; **remember, no quotes on name**  
`name <- 4`  
  
2. Return that object by typing its name  
`name`  
  
Try this in the code chunk below, then hit "Run Code"  

```{r my_first_object, exercise=TRUE}

```

## R has functions
- A name without quotes  
- Followed by () to run the function  
- Optional arguements: values, objects, or function results  
- `round(x, digits = 3)`

Try this in the code chunk below, then hit "Run Code"  

```{r my_first_fun, exercise=TRUE}
round(pi, digits = 3)

```

## Which of these are numbers?

```{r num_quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which of these are numbers?",
  answer("1", correct = TRUE),
  answer('"1"', message = "Because it has quotes, it is an string"),
  answer('"one"', message = "Because it has quotes, it is an string"),
  answer("one",  message = "R recognizes this as an object"), 
  allow_retry = TRUE, 
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## Which of these will work?
Suppose `one <- 1`
```{r one_quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which of these will work?",
  answer("log(1)", correct = TRUE),
  answer('log("1")', message = "You cannot log transform a word (string)"),
  answer('log("one")', message = "You cannot log transform a word (string)"),
  answer("log(one)", correct = TRUE), 
  allow_retry = TRUE, 
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```
Try it for yourself!  
  
```{r scratchpad, exercise=TRUE}
one <- 1
```

## Data are stored in tables and dataframes
Data stored in a dataframe are conceptually equivalent to a spreadsheet with rows and columns  
  
This is a sample from the ``r dataframe_name`` dataset  
  
```{r kable}
df_input %>% 
  select(1:5) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Data are stored in tables and dataframes
Data stored in a dataframe are conceptually equivalent to a spreadsheet with rows and columns  
  
This is a sample from the ``r dataframe_name`` dataset  
  
```{r tibble}
df_input %>% 
  select(1:5) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  print(as_tibble())
```

## Extract or create new objects
```{r extract_setup, include=FALSE}
col <- sample(colnames(df_input), 1)
```

You can call a single part of the data frame  
  
`r dataframe_name`$`r col`

```{r extract, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df_input %>% 
  select(!!col)
```

## Extract or create new objects 
  
Write the R code required to extract a variable from the `r dataframe_name` dataset:  
  
Remember, the format is: `r dataframe_name`$`r col`  
  
```{r extract_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Extract or create new objects 
  
You can also save a part of the dataframe as an object for later use  
  
``r col` <- `r dataframe_name`$`r col``  
  
In the code chunk below:  
1. On the first line, write the R code to save a single column to a new object   
2. On the second line, type the object name - this will print out the new object  
3. Run the code  
  
```{r create_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```

# R <br>Packages
Any questions?

## R Packages
The R language contains thousands of functions, data sets, and help pages.  
- but only a few hundred are included when you download R  
  
**This is called 'Base R'**  
  
The other functions, data sets, and help pages are grouped into collections known as packages that you can choose to download or not download.  

## “Verbs” (i.e. functions) act on data

`do_this(to_that)`  
  
`do_this(to_that, using_these)`  
   
*We talked about functions before (e.g. `round(pi, 3)`)*  
  
  
  
  
**Functions are the power of using R**

## Packages contain functions, documentation, data
  
<center><iframe src="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org"></iframe></center>

## CRAN
- Most R packages are stored on CRAN, alongside R.  
- Think of them as optional extensions of the R language.  
  
```{r cran, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.height = '66%', out.width= '66%'}
url <- "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/3cf06d6db4be2bbe3368/raw/b66b0531fb1b86d3e04a003b2e105ad4f147900e/number-of-submitted-packages-to-CRAN.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
<font size = "1">Image by [daroczig](https://gist.github.com/daroczig/3cf06d6db4be2bbe3368)</font>
  
## Using Packages (Part I)
  
1. `install.packages("tidyverse")`  
  
Do this 1 time per computer.  
  
This command will install the package into your instance of R, whether it is local, on a server, or in the cloud. This is required to use the functions in a package.  
  
## Tidyverse
  
<center><iframe src="https://www.tidyverse.org"></iframe></center>

## Tidyverse Pop Quiz!

The tidyverse contains the following packages (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, hms, stringr, lubridate, forcats, DBI, haven, httr, jsonlite, readxl, rvest, xml2, modelr, tidyverse).   
  
  
  
  
**How would you  install them?**

## Tidyverse Pop Quiz! {.build}
`install.packages("ggplot2")`
`install.packages("dplyr")`
`install.packages("tidyr")`
`install.packages("readr")`
`install.packages("purrr")`
`install.packages("tibble")`
`install.packages("hms")`
`install.packages("stringr")`
`install.packages("lubridate")`
`install.packages("forcats")`
`install.packages("DBI")`
`install.packages("haven")`
`install.packages("httr")`
`install.packages("jsonlite")`
`install.packages("readxl")`
`install.packages("rvest")`
`install.packages("xml2")`
`install.packages("modelr")`
`install.packages("broom")`  
  
  
  
Better:  
`install.packages("tidyverse")`  
An R package that serves as a short cut for installing and loading the components of the tidyverse.

## Using Packages (Part II)
  
1.`install.packages("tidyverse")`  
  
Do this 1 time per *computer*.  
  
  
2.`library(tidyverse)`  
  
Do this 1 time per *session*  
  
## Using Packages (Part II) {.build}
**Downloading a package isn't the same as using it.**  
  
If you'd like to use an R package, you need to tell R.  
You do that by running the command `library`, again followed by parentheses and the package name.  
  
`library(package_name)`  
  
This command loads all of the  functions, data sets, and help pages that come with the package into your R session, where you can use them.  
  
*If you close R, you'll need to reload the package with library() if you want to use it again.*  
  
  
## Using Packages (Part III)
The setup chunk is always run once before anything else  

```{r setup_chunk, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width='66%'}

url <- "https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/raw/master/diagrams/data-science.png"

```

## Tidyverse Basic Principles
**IMPORT** (readr):  
- `read_csv()`  
- `read_delim()`  
  
**TIDY & TRANSFORM** (dplyr):  
- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables  
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.  
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.  
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.  
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.  
  
**VISUALISE** (ggplot): creating graphics, based on ‘The Grammar of Graphics’  
- `aes()`  
- `geom_x()` + layers   
  
**MODEL** (broom):   
- `tidy()`, `glance()`, `augment()`

## The Pipe {.build}
  The “pipe” is a sequence of functions, that are sequentially applied to an object  
```{r wakeup, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
wakeup(self) %>%
  put_on("clothes") %>%
  eat("breakfast") %>%
  go(to = "work")
```
  
  Alternative nested code:  
```{r wakeup_nested, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
go(eat(put_on(wakeup(self), "clothes"), "breakfast"), to = "work")
```

# R <br>Getting to know your data
Any questions?

## ``r dataframe_name`` dataset
**`r dataframe_title`**  
  
- For this class, we will use a dataset called ``r dataframe_name``.  
  
- `r dataframe_source`  
  
- `r dataframe_desc`  
  
## Inspecting your dataframe: dimensions

Use the `dim()` function to see how many rows (observations) and columns (variables) are in ``r dataframe_name``

`dim(`r dataframe_name`)` 
  
Enter your function here:  
```{r dim_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Inspecting your dataframe: glimpse

Use the `glimpse()` function to see what kinds of variables the ``r dataframe_name`` dataset contains   
  
`glimpse(`r dataframe_name`)`  
  
Enter your function here:  
```{r glimpse_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```
  
## Basic Data Types in R {.build}

Recall that R has different data types -

**character** - `"a"`, `"tidyverse"`  

**numeric** - `2`, `11.5`  

**integer** - `2L` (the `L` tells R to store this as an integer)  

**logical** - `TRUE`, `FALSE`  

**complex** - `1+4i`  

(**raw**)

You will also come across the **double** datatype. It is the same as **numeric**

**factor**. A **factor** is a collection of *ordered* character variables

## Basic Data Types in R

In addition to the `glimpse()` function, you can use the `class()` function to determine the data type of a specific column

`class(`r dataframe_name`$`r colnames(df_character_select)`)`

```{r class, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
class(df_character_select[[1]])
```
  
Try getting the `class` of a variable:  
```{r class_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```
## (Re)Introducing `%>%` {.build}

The `%>%` operator is a way of "chaining" together strings of commands that make reading your code easy.  
The following code chunk illustrates how `%>%` works:  
  
``r dataframe_name` %>%`  
    `select(`r colnames(df_character_select)`, `r colnames(df_numeric_select)`) %>%`   
    `filter(`r colnames(df_character_select)` == "`r df_character_filter`") %>%`   
    `head()`  

```{r %>%, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df_input %>%
  select(colnames(df_character_select), colnames(df_numeric_select)) %>% 
  filter(!!rlang::sym(colnames(df_character_select)) == as.character(df_character_filter)) %>% 
  head()
```

## (Re)Introducing `%>%` {.build}

The previous code chunk does the following - it takes your dataset and then "pipes" it into `select()`, and then applies a `filter()` to the data.
  
``r dataframe_name` %>%`  
    `select(`r colnames(df_character_select)`, `r colnames(df_numeric_select)`) %>%`   
    `filter(`r colnames(df_character_select)` == "`r df_character_filter`") %>%`   
    `head()`  
  
*the `head` function lists only the top n results -- convenient for long variables*
  
  
**When you see `%>%`, think "and then"**

## (Re)Introducing `%>%` {.build}

The alternative to using `%>%` is running the following code

filter(select(`r dataframe_name`, `r colnames(df_character_select)`, `r colnames(df_numeric_select)`), `r colnames(df_character_select)` == "`r df_character_filter`")

Although this is only one line as opposed to three, it's both more difficult to write and more difficult to read  
  

## Introducing `dplyr` {.build}
  
dplyr is a package that contains a suite of functions that allow you to easily manipulate a dataset  
  
Some of the things you can do are -  
  
- select rows and columns that match specific criteria  
  
- create new variables (columns)  
  
- obtain summary statistics on individual groups within your datasets  
  
The main verbs we will cover are `select()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()`. These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation "by group"  
 
## `select()` specific columns from your dataset {.build}
The most basic `select()` is one where you comma separate a list of columns you want included

For example, if you only want to select the `r colnames(df_character_select)` and `r colnames(df_numeric_select)` columns, run the following code chunk

``r dataframe_name` %>%`   
    `select(`r colnames(df_character_select)`, `r colnames(df_numeric_select)`) %>%`  
    `head()`
    
```{r select_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```

## `select()` {.build}

If you want to select all columns *except* `r colnames(df_character_select)`, run the following

``r dataframe_name` %>%`  
    `select(-`r colnames(df_character_select)`) %>%`  
    `head(5)`

```{r selectnot_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```

## `select()` {.build}

Finally, you can provide a range of columns to return two columns and everything in between. For example

``r dataframe_name` %>%`   
    `select(`r colnames(df_character_select)`:`r colnames(df_numeric_select)`) %>%`  
    `head(5)`
    
```{r selectrange_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```
## `filter()` rows based on certain condition(s) {.build}

The `filter()` verb evalutes a logical statement, and if a row meets the condition of this statement (i.e. is true) then it gets chosen (or "filtered").  
  
  
**All other rows are discarded**  

## `filter()` {.build}

Filtering can be performed on **categorical** data

``r dataframe_name` %>%`     
    `filter(`r colnames(df_character_select)` == "`r df_character_filter`") %>%`     
    `head(3)`  

```{r filter_exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```

Note that `filter()` only applies to rows, and has no effect on columns

## `filter()` {.build}

Filtering can also be performed on **numeric** data

For example, if you wanted to choose `r colnames(df_numeric_select)` with a value greater than `r df_numeric_filter`, you would run the following. 

``r dataframe_name` %>%`     
    `filter(`r colnames(df_numeric_select)` > `r df_numeric_filter`) %>%`     
    `head(3)`  

```{r filter_exercise2, exercise=TRUE}

```

## `filter()` {.build}

To filter on multiple conditions, you can write a sequence of `filter()` commands

``r dataframe_name` %>%`       
    `filter(`r colnames(df_character_select)` == "`r df_character_filter`") %>%`  
    `filter(`r colnames(df_numeric_select)` > `r df_numeric_filter`) %>%`    
    `head(3)`  

```{r filter_exercise3, exercise=TRUE}

```

## `filter()` {.build}

To avoid writing multiple `filter()` commands, multiple logical statements can be put inside a single `filter()` command, separated by commas

``r dataframe_name` %>%`           
    `filter(`r colnames(df_character_select)` == "`r df_character_filter`",`  
           ` `r colnames(df_numeric_select)` > `r df_numeric_filter`) %>%`      
    `head(3)`  

```{r filter_exercise4, exercise=TRUE}

```

  `geom(mapping = aes(x, y))`  
  
Take a moment to look back at the code template.  You can see that in that code we assigned a `dataset` and the information we needed to `map` it to a type of plot

## Basics of a ggplot code {.build}
  
`ggplot(data = `r dataframe_name`) +`  
`geom_point(mapping=aes(x = `r df_numeric1_name`, y = `r df_numeric2_name`))`  
  
```{r simple_plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df_input %>% 
  ggplot(aes(!!sym(df_numeric1_name), !!sym(df_numeric2_name))) +
  geom_point() 
```

## Build a `ggplot` {.build}
- "Initialize" a plot with `ggplot()`  
  
`ggplot(data = `r dataframe_name`) +`  
  
- Add layers with `geom_functions`  
  
`geom_point(mapping=aes(x = `r df_numeric1_name`, y = `r df_numeric2_name`))`  

## Notes on `ggplot` style {.build}
- Generally, different people have **strong** opinions about style and data visualization  
  
- Data visualization is a rich and complex area of study and is beyond the scope of this introductory course  
  
**That being said, here are a few style tips:**    
- While you can put the `+` at the beginning of the next line, it is generally put at the end of the previous line    
  
- Arguments do not need to be explicit: this chunk of code is equivalent to the previous chunk (w/ data, mappings)  
`ggplot(`r dataframe_name`) +`    
`geom_point(aes(x = `r df_numeric2_name`, y = `r df_numeric2_name`))`  

## Aesthetics
Everything up to this point gets you a basic graph; but what about colors, shapes and overall style?  
  
You can change 5 basic aesthetics  
1. **Color**- changes the outline color of your datapoints  
2. **Size** - choose the size of the datapoint  
3. **Shape** - choose a pre-defined shape  
4. **Alpha**- changes the transparency of each point  
5. **Fill**- changes the fill color of your points  
  
  
## Mapping these aesthetics to data
Beyond simply changing the size or color of the variables in your plot, you can encode more information by mapping these values to data in your data set.  
  
  
## Global vs Local {.build}
In ggplot2, we have the options to set mappings globally or locally. Setting a mapping globally means to set those values in the original ggplot function.  
  
Example:  

`ggplot(`r dataframe_name`) +`  
  `geom_jitter(aes(x=`r df_char1_name`, y=`r df_numeric1_name`))+`  
  `geom_boxplot(aes(x=`r df_char1_name`, y=`r df_numeric1_name`))`  
  
## How are these two plots similar?
```{r double_plot, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot1 <- df_input %>% 
  ggplot(aes(!!sym(df_numeric1_name), !!sym(df_numeric2_name))) +
  geom_point() 

plot2 <- df_input %>% 
  ggplot(aes(!!sym(df_numeric1_name), !!sym(df_numeric2_name))) +
  geom_smooth() 

plot1 + plot2
```

## The `geom` is different between these plots
`geom` is short for geometric object, which is the visual object used to represent the data  
    
`plot1 <- ggplot(`r dataframe_name`) +`  
  `geom_point(aes(`r df_numeric1_name`, `r df_numeric2_name`))`   
  
`plot2 <-  ggplot(`r df_numeric1_name`, `r df_numeric2_name`) +`  
  `geom_smooth(aes(`r df_numeric1_name`, `r df_numeric2_name`))`   

## Choosing your (geom)etries
Different data types require different plot types.  
  
When plotting your data, it is often helpful to take a glimpse at the data you intend to plot to know what kinds of variables you will be working with

`glimpse(`r dataframe_name`)`
```{r glimpse_again, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Geoms 
So now that you know your variable types, how do you know what geoms to use??  
  
Use the following resources to match your data type to the appropriate `geoms`

## Change this scatterplot code to draw boxplots {.smaller} 
`ggplot(`r dataframe_name`) + geom_point(aes(x=`r df_char1_name`,y=`r df_numeric1_name`))`  
```{r boxplot_activity, exercise = TRUE}

```
  
Use the cheatsheet. Try your best guess.  

## What will this code do?
  
`ggplot(`r dataframe_name`) +`   
`geom_boxplot(aes(x=`r df_char1_name`,y=`r df_numeric1_name`)) +`  
`geom_point(aes(x=`r df_char1_name`,y=`r df_numeric1_name`))`  

## Try including two `geoms` for yourself
```{r 2geom_activity, exercise = TRUE}

```
  
**Each new geom adds a new layer**

When you run render, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to knitr ⧉, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and it’s output.  
  
The markdown file generated by `knitr` is then processed by `pandoc` which is responsible for creating the finished format.  
  
This may sound complicated, but R Markdown makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single render function.  
  
## Key `knitr` points {.build}
- `Knitr` runs the document in a fresh R session, which means you need to load the libraries that the document uses **in the document**  
  
- Objects made in one code chunk will be available to code in later code chunks, but not before  
  
- For example, first create `r dataframe_name` and then using `dplyr::left_join` you create `r dataframe_joined_name`, `r dataframe_name` will be available later on in the document to do this. **However, you cannot use `r dataframe_joined_name` in a code chunk before you make it, even if it is available in your environmnet**  
  
- To keep this straight, just think (and code) in sequential chunks
